# Convert Blynk reports into .PDF reports.

## Using Flask, Python and Heroku.

Created this app in order to converted .zip files generated from Reports widget from Blynk app to a graph on .pdf

TODO, Known issues:

- [ ] Make it looks nicer;
- [ ] Some of my devices export the .csv file as UTF-8 and UTF-16 causing confusion
- [X] Working with "Device" and "DataStream" Reports option
- [ ] When using "Device" report to include data name to the Y label or to the legend
- [X] Delete files after downloading it
